this plugin implements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

Multiple tools have been used during development to speed up development and keep things neat!

- [CheckStyle](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea) has been used to create well formatted, consistent code (and enforce final usage)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/old/) has been used to code the plugin, as it offers great plugin support!

## üë£ Versioning

Whilst developing this plugin, I have used [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for the current versions of the plugin, see the [list of created versions so far](https://github.com/MinecraftFreelance/FactionShield/tags)!. I have created an automatic versioning system that automatically
increments the version (see `.github/workflows/release.yaml`), this automatically increases the version every time a commit is made to the main branch of this repository.

## üèóÔ∏è Building the plugin

This plugin is automatically versioned using a GitHub action (as mentioned above), in order to build the plugin. Create an environment variable called "RELEASE_VERSION" on your machine and give it a value (you can do this using `$RELEASE_VERSION=value` on a Linux/Unix machine.

This Spigot plugin is built using maven, using the provided `pom.xml` file.

```
mvn build
```

This will create a jar file in the root directory of the repository, this can be used to put into the `/plugins` folder.
